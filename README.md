# OrnlWeather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.2.

## Development server

This program is for requesting weather data from National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Same as the [NCEI LCD Website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/lcd/) this program will give the user the option to select a weather station they wish to receive data from, choose the dataset elements, the timeframe over which they need their data and will give the user the ability to download the csv for that selected data. This program will give the user the ability to instantly receive this data rather then waiting for the NCEI Website to send it to them. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
